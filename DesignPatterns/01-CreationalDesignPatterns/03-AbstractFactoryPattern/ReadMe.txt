Advantages:
Flexibility: The pattern allows for the easy addition of new product families or variations without modifying existing client code.
Encapsulation: Concrete classes are encapsulated within their respective factories, reducing dependencies and making it easier to manage changes.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: Implementing the pattern can lead to a large number of classes and interfaces, potentially increasing code complexity.
