In simple terms, the Factory Method Pattern is like a recipe for making things, 
but it lets different chefs (subclasses) create their own unique versions of those things while sticking to the same basic cooking instructions (the Factory Method).

Real-World Use Cases:
GUI Libraries: GUI frameworks often use this pattern for creating UI components like buttons, windows, and dialogs. 
Different operating systems may have different implementations for these components.

Advantages:
Flexibility: It allows you to add new product types or change the way objects are created without modifying existing client code.
Encapsulation: The creation logic is encapsualted withing the concrete creators, promoting information hiding and modularity.
Testing: You easily substitue different product types with mock objects for testing purposes.

Disadvantages:
Increased Complexity: Introduces more classes and potential tight coupling, making the codebase more complex.
Tight Coupling: Concrete creators may be tightly linked to specific products, making changes cumbersome.
