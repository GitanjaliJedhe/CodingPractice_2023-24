Example:
class InvoiceDao/*Data Access Layer or Object*/ {
	Invoice invoice;

	public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice) {
		this.invoice = invoice;
	}

	public void saveToDB() {
		// Save the data into DB
	}
}

Wrong Solution:
class InvoiceDao/*Data Access Layer or Object*/ {
	Invoice invoice;

	public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice) {
		this.invoice = invoice;
	}

	public void saveToDB() {
		// Save the Invoice into DB
	}

	public void saveToFile(String filename) {
		// Save the Invoice in the File with the given name
	}

}


Correct Solution:
interface InvoiceDao {
	public void save(Invoice invoice);
}


class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao {
	@override
	public void save(Invoice invoice) {
		// Save to DB
	}
}

class FileInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao {
	@override
	public void save(Invoice invoice) {
		// Save to file
	}
}
