Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes

Example:
class MacBook {
	private final Wiredkeyboard keyboard; // Concrete class
	private final WiredMouse mouse; // Concrete class

	public MacBook() {
		keyboard = new Wiredkeyboard();
		mouse = new WiredMouse();
	}
}

Correct Solution:
class MacBook {
	private final Keyboard keyboard; // Interfaces
	private final Mouse mouse; // Interfaces

	public MacBook(Keyboard keyboard, Mouse mouse) {
		this.keyboard = keyboard;
		this.mouse = mouse;
	}	
}
