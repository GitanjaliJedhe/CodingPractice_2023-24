The Liskov Substitution principle is a little harder to understand, it states that a child class should always be able to perform the same actions as its parent.

So if we had an actual Parent Class that has the actions:
Eat
Sleep
Work
MakeDinner
Then we have a Child Class that is inherited from the Parent Class, there are obviously some actions that the child cannot do such as MakeDinner or Work.

This would therefore break the Liskov Substitution Principle as we canâ€™t replace the child with the parent.

It would therefore make more sense to have a Human class and then have Adult and Child classes inherit from that class instead.
