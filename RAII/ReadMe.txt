When the object is created, the resource is acquired, and when the object is destroyed, the resource is released.

RAII relies on C++ features such as constructors, destructors, and scope-bound resource management to achieve its goals. 

It is widely used in C++ standard library components, such as smart pointers, containers, and I/O streams, and can also be employed in user-defined classes.
