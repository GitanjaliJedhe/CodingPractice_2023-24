It does the same thing but by code, so you can integrate it in an automatic build system, 
the functions _CrtMemCheckpoint take the snapshots and _CrtMemDifference compare the memory states of snapshot and returns true is they are different.

via several functions (see _CrtMemDumpStatistics , _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince and _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks - the latter doesn't require snapshots).

To see the output, put a break point in the last line "return 0", hit F5 and look at the debug console. Here is the output :
