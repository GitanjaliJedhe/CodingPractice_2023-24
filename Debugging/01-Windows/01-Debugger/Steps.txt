Create the following main.cpp file (in a new console application) :

#include <string.h>
int main()
{
 int a = 1;
 char* s = new char[17];
 strcpy_s(s,17,"stackoverflow_pb");
 char* ss = new char[14];
 strcpy_s(ss, 14,"stackoverflow");
 delete[] ss;
 return 0;
}

Then :
1) Put a breakpoint on the first line "int a..."
2) Click Debug > Windows > Show Diagnostic Tools; and pick memory usage
3) Then debug the code (F5), when the breakpoint is hit, click Take snapshot on the Memory Usage summary toolbar.
4) Go to the last line "return 0.." (step over (F10) several times) and take another snapshot.
5) Click on the red arrow in the second snapshot (in memory usage tab)
6)this will open a new "snapshot" tab that permits you to compare this snapshot with the first one (or another one) and to detect memory leaks. In this example there is a memory leak for variable s (stackoverflow_pb). You can find it by double click the "char[]" object.
